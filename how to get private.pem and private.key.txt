Requirements: java, openssl (, jadx)

1. Download rewe.apk  (e.g. https://rewe.de.uptodown.com/android)

2. Download apktool  (https://apktool.org/)

3. Run java -jar apktool.jar d rewe.apk  (e.g. java -jar apktool_2.9.3.jar d rewe-3-18-5.apk)

4. Search in the newly created folder (created by apktool) for mtls_prod.pfx

5. Get the password from the rewe.apk source code:
5a. NC3hDTstMX9waPPV  (worked for 3.18.5 and 3.17.1)
5b. Open rewe.apk with jadx-gui and search for mtls_prod. Search in the found classes for an integer-array. (There are probably two integer arrays.) Convert the one that is actually used in the class (probably called numArr) into characters (e.g. with Python function chr()). Done - you got the password.

6. Split mtls_prod.pfx into certificate and private key (enter the password from step 5 when your asked for it):
6a. Certificate:  openssl pkcs12 -in mtls_prod.pfx -out private.pem -legacy -nokeys
6b. Private Key:  openssl pkcs12 -in mtls_prod.pfx -out private.key -legacy -nocerts -nodes
